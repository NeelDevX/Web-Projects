# Web-Projects
Front-End Projects Collection — A showcase of my mini web projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each folder contains a standalone project demonstrating different UI layouts, animations, and interactive features. Perfect for exploring responsive design, DOM manipulation, and creative front-end problem-solving.
